This repository holds the m5 (http://www.m5sim.org/) source tree used by HAsim.
It is currently based on release 2.0b5.

The original source tree is stored in the m5 subdirectory.  We modify that tree
locally as little as possible to simplify moving to a new version.  HAsim ISA-
specific libraries using m5 will build instances of m5 within their own
source trees as part of the configure / build step.
